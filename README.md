## 🪷 Introduction

This repo hosts my [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration for Linux, macOS, and Windows. `init.lua` is the config entry point.

Branch info:

<div align="center">

|   Branch   | Supported Neovim version |
| :--------: | :----------------------: |
|   master   |     nvim 0.10 stable     |

> [!CAUTION]
> This Neovim config is provided as-is, and I've only tested it on my own devices, so bugs are possible, especially on Windows, and I **won't** be fixing them. If you're interested in this config, please kindly have a look at [ayamir/nvimdots](https://github.com/ayamir/nvimdots) which we maintain. It also offers many wonderful features that I personally don't need, such as NixOS support.

### 🎐 Features

- **Fast.** Less than **30ms** to start (Depends on SSD and CPU, tested on Zephyrus G14 2022 version).
- **Simple.** Runs out of the box.
- **Modern.** Pure `lua` config.
- **Modular.** Easy to customize.
- **Powerful.** Full functionality to code.

## 🏗 How to Install

Simply run the following interactive bootstrap command, and you should be all set 👍

- **Windows** _(Note: This script REQUIRES `pwsh` > `v7.1`)_

```pwsh
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jint-lzxy/nvimconfig/HEAD/scripts/install.ps1'))
```

- **\*nix**

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jint-lzxy/nvimconfig/HEAD/scripts/install.sh)"
```
